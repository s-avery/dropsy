## BEM Class Naming

I structured my html/css classes using the [BEM approach](http://getbem.com/naming/), which is why the naming convention for those is different from my JS naming. I kept the usage of kebabCase across the project, and used BEM for its ease of managing CSS selectors.

## CSS Structure

I created several "partials" and imported them all into app.css -- I hope this fulfills the "all css in one file" requirement for the project, but the idea of coding the CSS in one huge file and scrolling past the setup snippet made me feel like a dying creature. Please understand.
